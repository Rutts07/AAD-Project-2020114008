# AAD-Project-2020114008
Contains the files for the website of algorithms. This is repository for the Algorithm Analysis and Design Project.

- My idea for this project is to make an interactive website for algorithm paradigms
- This website has been created using HTML, external CSS and internal Javascript
- In addition to this, bootstrap and sweetalert libraries have also been used ...


## Phase-wise Work Division :

- [x] Phase 1 - (Completed : Oct 20th)
  - Rephrasing the theory of the algorithm design techniques into simple steps (or sub tasks)
  - I have chosen divide and conquer, greedy and dynamic programming approaches
 
- [x] Phase 2 - (Completed : Oct 22nd)
  - Selecting / refining the examples for each paradigm
 
  - Currently I have the following examples for each paradigm :
    - [x] Divide and conquer : Merge sort
    - [x] Greedy strategy : Selection sort
    - [x] Dynamic Programming : Nth Fibonacci number using DP, Insertion sort
  
- [x] Phase 3 - (Completed : Nov 1st)
  - Design the menu-driven to make the website interactive 
  
  - Issues :
    - [x] Make a decorative navbar
    - [x] Link the webpages of the algorithm paradigms  
  
- [x] Phase 4 - (Completed : Nov 25th)
  - Write programs to automatically execute the stepwise tasks of the chosen examples

  - To Do :
    - Divide and Conquer Paradigm :
      - [x] Merge Sort
     
    - Greedy Strategy :  
      - [x] Selection Sort
      
    - Dynamic Programming :
      - [x] Nth Fibonacci Number using DP
      - [x] Insertion Sort
   
- [x] Phase 5 - (Completed :Dec 1st)
  - Write the report

## Usage Guidelines :

- Clone this repository in your local machine. Please do not alter the file structure. (P.S :) You can ditch README.md and Report/)
- Tested all the HTML, CSS and JS files in ```Brave``` browser. Disclaimer : May not work in other browsers
- Open ```home.html``` (after which you will be able to navigate to and from this webpage to others)


### Hope you guys benefit from my website !!!
